        <ul>
            <li>200 gm unsweetened dark chocolate bar</li>
            <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
            <li>3 medium eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a sauce pan, Cut your chocolate into little chunks, and melt it together with the butter in a double boiler setup. Once it's melted, set it aside t cool down for abit while you start with the dry ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, put your white and brown sugars together, and crack one egg and whisk it in one by one, untill all the sugar is creamed.</li>
            <li>Once the sugar is creamed and mixed well with the eggs, add the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>While mixing, pour in the chocolate and butter mixture into the sugar and eggs. make sure the chocolate isn't too hot or it might cook the eggs.</li>
            <li>Once properly incorporated, sift in the flour and cocoa powder into your wet mix.</li>
            <li>Slowly fold the flour and cocoa into your batter. DO NOT OVER MIX, or too much air will get into the batter and the brownie might end up cakey</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a 7x7 inch pan, and put the pan into a preheated oven at 180 Â°C for 25-30 minutes. At around 25 minutes, check the brownie with a toothpick. It should come out slightly chocolatey but not too much and not completely clean.</li>
            <li>Let cool off for a few hours before cutting into sqaures pieces.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
